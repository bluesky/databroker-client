# TypeScript React app using Material UI to develop a DataBroker server client.

Install it and run:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

The client proxies to the server on port 6942, if it is running on a different
port you will need to change that in the package.json (or just switch the
server port to match using --port 6942 when launching uvicorn).
